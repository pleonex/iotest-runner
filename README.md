Run and test your programs from Atom using input and output files. The plugin will run the program, write to the standard input the content of some test files and compare with the output files.

It is compatible with Python scripts but it would be easy to extend to other scripting languages.

*The original goal of this plugin is to test quickly problems from the IEEEXtreme challenge.*
